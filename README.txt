# Java Chat App: Connect, Encrypt, Chat üöÄ

Welcome to my Java Chat App, where code meets conversation in a lightweight, local server-based messaging environment. This isn't just any chat application; it's a developer's playground for exploring real-time networking, encryption, and the nuances of Java Swing. Tailored for those who love to tinker, this project combines functionality with learning in a package that's as intriguing to set up as it is to use.

## Features That Spark Curiosity üîç

- **Dynamic User List with IPs**: Dive into a session and immediately see who's online alongside their IP addresses. It's networking made transparent, perfect for understanding how connections come to life.
- **Choose Your Port of Entry**: Freedom is key. That's why you can select which port to connect through, giving you the flexibility to run multiple instances or avoid conflicts with other services.
- **Encrypt Like a Pro**: With built-in encryption utilities, watch how simple algorithms can secure your messages. It's a hands-on lesson in cryptography, baked right into your chat experience.
- **Minimalist Swing GUI**: Focused on functionality, the GUI might be basic, but it's a clean slate waiting for your creative enhancements. It's all about making it yours.

## Quick Start Guide üèÅ

### Setting Up the Server

1. **Fire Up the Server**: Compile and run `ChatServer.java`. This crucial first step prepares your machine to become the meeting point for all chat clients.
   
2. **Customize Your Experience**: Decide on a port number that suits you. This flexibility ensures your chat server can run harmoniously alongside other projects or applications.

### Launching the Client

1. **Enter the Chat**: Compile and run `ChatClientView.java` for each user. This is your gateway to the chatroom, where messages flow, and connections are made.

2. **Connect Your Way**: Using the GUI, select the port you've set up for your server. Hit connect, and you're in. It's that simple.

### Dive Into the Conversation

- **Chat Publicly or Privately**: Share your thoughts with the group or whisper to someone specific. This app supports both, making it versatile for every type of conversation.
- **Experiment with Encryption**: Toggle the encryption feature to see your messages secured and then decrypted on arrival. It's a practical intro to data privacy.

## Beyond the Basics üåü

This project is more than just a chat app; it's a starting point for deeper exploration into Java networking, GUI development, and basic encryption. Whether you're looking to implement more advanced cryptographic techniques, enhance the UI, or expand the app's functionality, there's plenty of room for growth.
